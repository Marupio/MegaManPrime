TODO
Need to look again at KVariableSet stuff.
Limits is having trouble with Single and multi.
Remove all Min restrictions? - this will change MagMinMax, InputRange, etc
Refactor InputRange to accept 1D, 2D and 3D inputs



Axis can change frequently
Axis source is more static

I think we need to decouple control axes from movement axes


Movement: based on DOFs - no, based on RigidBody[2D] constraints
    WorldSpace - 2D, 3D
    Spatial movement - 1, 2, 3
    Rotations - 1, 2, 3

2D World
Spatial movement - 0, 1, 2 (axis aligned)
Rotations - 0, 1

3D World
Spatial movement - 0, 1, 2, 3 (axis aligned)
Rotations - 0, 1, 2, 3

WorldSpace

if (World.nAxes > Control.nAxes) {
    // Control needs an alignment axis, projection
}

Movement breaks it down to axis controlls
