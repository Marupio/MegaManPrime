TODO
Nearly done Removing 'local' variables (position, velocity, rotation, etc) from WorldSpace.
* Update functions in ControlFields
* SumSources in WorldSpace
* [Project|Substitute][To|From]SubSpace in WorldSpace
* Apply limits
* Apply changes to rigidBody

Remove all Min restrictions?
    They are not useful to 2D, 3D, and 1D can assume Max restriction is Negative also.
    But having Max and Min limits makes sense, and I can apply them anywhere.



Axis can change frequently
Axis source is more static

I think we need to decouple control axes from movement axes


Movement: based on DOFs - no, based on RigidBody[2D] constraints
    WorldSpace - 2D, 3D
    Spatial movement - 1, 2, 3
    Rotations - 1, 2, 3

2D World
Spatial movement - 0, 1, 2 (axis aligned)
Rotations - 0, 1

3D World
Spatial movement - 0, 1, 2, 3 (axis aligned)
Rotations - 0, 1, 2, 3

WorldSpace

if (World.nAxes > Control.nAxes) {
    // Control needs an alignment axis, projection
}
