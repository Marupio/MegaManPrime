TODO
Still working on below.  I've changed template stuff to simplify things.  But didn't finish.
* [Project|Substitute][To|From]SubSpace in WorldSpace
    Working on this one now, it is getting ugly with templates, toolset, and now the subspace projection functions.
    I think I need to bring it all into one function.  Not initialiseVariables, project/substitute, Call control.Update, backsubstitute/project.
    Clean this up and make it pretty.
* Apply limits
* Apply changes to rigidBody

Remove all Min restrictions?
    They are not useful to 2D, 3D, and 1D can assume Max restriction is Negative also.
    But having Max and Min limits makes sense, and I can apply them anywhere.



Axis can change frequently
Axis source is more static

AxisMove(KVariableSet)

I think we need to decouple control axes from movement axes


Movement: based on DOFs - no, based on RigidBody[2D] constraints
    WorldSpace - 2D, 3D
    Spatial movement - 1, 2, 3
    Rotations - 1, 2, 3

2D World
Spatial movement - 0, 1, 2 (axis aligned)
Rotations - 0, 1

3D World
Spatial movement - 0, 1, 2, 3 (axis aligned)
Rotations - 0, 1, 2, 3

WorldSpace

if (World.nAxes > Control.nAxes) {
    // Control needs an alignment axis, projection
}
